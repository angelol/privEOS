# privEOS

This is the main privEOS repository containing the server-side software that all nodes in the privEOS network must run.

## Server Specs
You need a server with the following hardware specs:

* 4 GB of RAM
* 20 GB of Storage
* Bare metal or Cloud Server is both fine

These specs are valid for the testnet and might be increased over time as usage increases or as new functionality is introduced.

## Setting up a PrivEOS Node

You can choose between the [automated node setup](https://github.com/rawrat/priveos-automation) using Ansible or the [manual installation instructions](https://github.com/rawrat/privEOS/blob/master/Manual_Node_Setup.md). 

Using the automation setup is a great way to start up quickly. It will help in having a homogenous environment on all nodes. If you need deeper integration into the rest of your infrastructure or just prefer to do it yourself, the manual setup is right for you.

## Firewall Configuration
The privEOS software itself only listens on localhost, so there is no danger that services could inadvertently be exposed to the outside. Other services like MongoDB are configured to only listen on localhost as well by default. 

If you are using a firewall, please make sure that it allows stateful connections from the server to the outside. Additionally, the following ports need to be reachable from the outside:
* `22` or your custom OpenSSH port if you use non-standard port
* `80` We are running an SSL-only service, however the Let's Encrypt cronjob which automatically renews the certificate needs this port.
* `443` This is the standard SSL port that Nginx is listening on.
* `4001` We recommend opening this up for IPFS so other Swarm nodes can connect to us. This also makes our setup future-proof as there are ideas to build a private IPFS subnet consisting of privEOS nodes.

## Add Watchdog Permission

When a new node `regnode`s with privEOS, it is not active by default. It first has to be approved by a minimum number of peers. Every node runs the watchdog daemon for this purpose. It checks the status of new nodes, and if everything is okay, approves it by calling the `priveosrules:peerappr` action. Once a minimum number of peers have approved a certain node, it is activated. This is to make sure that only functional nodes can be activated.

The same process happens with currently active nodes. The watchdog regularly checks the status of all active nodes. If a node is offline or has a problem, the watchdog calls the `priveosrules:peerdisappr` action. Once a threshold amount of peer nodes have disapproved a node, it is being deactivated by the smart contract.

That's why every node needs to be able to call the actions `priveosrules:peerappr` and `priveosrules:peerdisappr` non-interactively. For this purpose, we create a custom permission that is linked to these actions.

Please generate a new, dedicated public/private keypair for this purpose and then create your custom permission like this:

    cleos set account permission YOUR_EOS_ACCOUNT watchdog YOUR_NEW_DEDICATED_PUBLIC_KEY active
    cleos set action permission YOUR_EOS_ACCOUNT priveosrules peerappr watchdog
    cleos set action permission YOUR_EOS_ACCOUNT priveosrules peerdisappr watchdog
    
This new permission named `watchdog` can only be used to call the above actions and nothing else, so it is safe to store this private key on the server.

This needs to be repeated for every chain.
    
## Registering your Node
Once your node is all set up, you can call ```priveosrules:regnode```, it's the privEOS equivalent of ```eosio:regproduce``` ðŸ™‚
Example command:

    cleos -u https://jungle2.cryptolions.io  push action priveosrules regnode '["YOUR_EOS_ACCOUNT", "YOUR_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY", "https://YOUR_SERVER_NAME"]' -p YOUR_EOS_ACCOUNT
    
The privEOS contract has a consensus mechanism to set the fees charged for the usage of privEOS. In order to check the current prices:

    # This is the price for storing files on privEOS:
    cleos -u https://jungle2.cryptolions.io get table priveosrules priveosrules storeprice
    
    # This is the price for reading from privEOS:
    cleos -u https://jungle2.cryptolions.io get table priveosrules priveosrules readprice

In order to set your price:
    
    cleos -u https://jungle2.cryptolions.io push action priveosrules setprice '["YOUR_EOS_ACCOUNT", "0.0000 EOS", "store"]' -p YOUR_EOS_ACCOUNT
    cleos -u https://jungle2.cryptolions.io push action priveosrules setprice '["YOUR_EOS_ACCOUNT", "0.0100 EOS", "accessgrant"]' -p YOUR_EOS_ACCOUNT

The price charged for reading and writing to privEOS will be the median of all prices set by the BPs.

This process needs to be repeated for every chain that you would like to connect to.

## Checking your Node Health
Once you've completed the ```regnode``` step above, your node should appear on the [privEOS monitor](https://monitor.priveos.io/). 

## Demux Syncing
Demux syncing works best with node that's in close network proximity. If you have problems keeping your demux index in sync with the tip of the chain, make sure you are using an API endpoint that is close to your server. We've observed problems when the ping to the API endpoint is greater than 100ms. So if you're in the UK and using an API Endpoint in Germany, you're probably okay, but not if you use one from Australia.

Demux is the easiest to set up because you can use any public API endpoint, but it has a few drawbacks. Currently, it does not support inline actions. PrivEOS also supports other backends such as the eosio::mongodb_plugin for nodeos. If you would like to test privEOS with mongodb_plugin, let us know on [Telegram](https://t.me/SLANT_official).

## Testing
For testing, you can use the [privEOS client library](https://github.com/rawrat/priveos-client)
